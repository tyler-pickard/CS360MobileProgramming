Project Summary:
  The goal of this project was to design a simple weight tracking app using Android Studio.  The page had to include a login page, a main page, and a text alert page.  My goal was to keep a simple and user friendly design for the project.  A logo was displayed on each page to provide branding.  The main page displayed the goal weight as well as the most recent entry.  The user would be able to enter their weight and the page would be updated.  There was also a grid layout to display other recent entries.
