Project Summary:
  The goal of this project was to design a simple weight tracking app using Android Studio.  The page had to include a login page, a main page, and a text alert page.  My goal was to keep a simple and user friendly design for the project.  A logo was displayed on each page to provide branding.  The main page displayed the goal weight as well as the most recent entry.  The user would be able to enter their weight and the page would be updated.  There was also a grid layout to display other recent entries.
  
Overview:
  This was a difficult project where I went from having no knowledge in app development to working towards developing a fully functional app.  I found the front side development of the app to be very interesting.  Working with the backend using java was much more of a challenge for me.  There were many steps that were involved with creating a fully fucntional app and there were areas I feel I came up short.  This was a great learning experience that helped build a foundation, but I will need to continue to build these skills beyond the 8 weeks of this course.
